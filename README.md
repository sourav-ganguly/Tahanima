> *"Struggling with something is growth. It doesnâ€™t matter how long you struggle with a concept or project; all that matters is that you have the grit and tenacity to see it through. Thatâ€™s how real learning happens." â€• The Odin Project*  

> *"It may take you longer than others to grasp concepts, or it may take you less time. This doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re smarter or dumber than others, it means youâ€™ve had differing life experiences that may or may not have prepared you for learning this stuff. Someone who grew up around an engineer may have some advantages over someone who didnâ€™t, but it doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t learn those skills." â€• The Odin Project*
